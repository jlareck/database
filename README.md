## Database
Implement training database "Monsters" with fields:

 - Name
 - Id (must be unique for any monster)
 - Health points
 - Damage
 - Chance of ultimate attack
 - Ultimate attack (increase damage , reapeat attack, healself or disable enemy)
 - date and time of creation
 
 Operations:
 
 - Create monster 
 - Save in memory (using std::vector or array or any other sata structure)
 - Save to database, text file or binary file (in my implementation I saved to database using sqlite library because it was task on extra points)
 - Read data from database
 - Print all monsters
 - Delete monster
 - Generate random monster
 - Search monster
 
 Implement interactive, demo modes and time benchmarks for all operations with reading and saving in database, binary file, text file and compare for each of them.
